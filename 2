 a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
 the chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself

 on saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneeling desk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses
 her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
 if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her night

 but the dusk deepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts the bell rang

 stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by saying
 it was strange to that he found an arrowed pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
 the sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state

 why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
 if the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
 a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
 the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
 he clasped his hands on the desk and said
 the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in honor of saint francis saviour whose feast day is saturday
 on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads
 beware of making that mistake
 stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower
 he is called as you know the apostle of the indies
 a great saint saint francis savior
 the rector paused and then shaking his clasp to hands before him went on
 he had the faith in him that moves mountains
 a great saint saint francis caviar
 in the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow
 he could wait no longer
 for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer

 pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves

 the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
 soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
 the uncouth faces passed him to by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
 angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk cats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes

 their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richard tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift ten fold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
 it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggar's weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
 idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love

 you will find me continually speaking of four men titian whole by tarnal and cigarette in almost the same terms
 they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as cure christs
 by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the curiosities devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing separated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of life
 my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side

 for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be read and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is an instantly seizing on the manifold maliciousness of light which you can only cease by precision which you can only cease by precision which
 now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonize with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of entreated white paper all round it being sure that

 do not therefore think that the gothic schools in easy one
 the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on the golden ground
 this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact your producing jewellers work rather than pictures
 that a styles were strained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
 in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion in rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
 the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
 but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
 it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purest painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
 you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
 the colorist says first of all as my delicious earache was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him sly me all the same and yet springy and close down
 nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great and spirit and in matter
 you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last and cloud and fire
 here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholly and golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatsoever perfectly accepted in marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist
 now here is raphael exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf holy formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
 while then last here is turns greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and in the envelopment of it would cloud and fire

 but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why turner drew it at all
 it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped in poor

 thought kills me that i am not thought to leave large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend times leisure with my moan receiving not by elements so slow
 my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierced with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies
 you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steeled sense or changes write or wrong

 it was this observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
 some one else told storing up particularly effective which i saw he was not following
 cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
 there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after rich in his preoccupied way he explained
 the stories written
 i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it
 the others resented for atonement but it was just as group as the charmed me
 to this his answer was prompt who thank god know and is the recognises
 he hung fire again a woman's
 she has been dead these twenty years
 she sent me the pages and questioned before she died
 she was the most agreeable woman i'd ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
 twasn't simply that she said so but that i knew she hadn't i was sure i could see
 your easily judge why when you hear because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me
 you are acute
 he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
 probably not till the second post
 it was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay
 cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed
 missus griffin however expressed the need for a little more light
 who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wait to the story the story won't tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way more's the pity then
 won't you tell douglas
 for all if i don't know who she was in lover it i know who he was
 let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
 poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
 the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
 the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner begun
 he had for his own town residence of big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
 the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations am that his own affairs took up all his time
 they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
 i don't anticipate
 she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company for really great loneliness
 yes but that's just the beauty of her passion
 it was the beauty of it
 it sounded dull that sounded strange and all the more so because of his name condition which was
 she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that went for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
 but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
 how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
 god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
 yet these thoughts affected hester prim less with hope than apprehension
 the child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became at best
 this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
 hester could only account for the child's character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling which she herself had been during that moment is period while pearl was inviting her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
 they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
 hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
 mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant and mortality that was committed to her charge
 as to any other kind of discipline whether address to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
 it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not have questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
 beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood
 brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has a vote desprit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
 pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
 pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
 if spoken too she would not speak again
 hester print went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused the sooner ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank
 another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
 at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and a far less in twins weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
 the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
 we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin
 it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
 the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt
 but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only and consequence of that identity had header contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
 come therefore and let us fling mut at them
 but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
 she screamed and shouted to with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
 it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and adorable for the admiration of after times
 they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticed windows the wooden shudders to close over them that need
 lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's bond servants a free born english man but now a seven years slave
 yea his honourable worship is within but he hath a godly minister or two with him and likewise a leech
 ye may not see his worship now
 with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fairest state in his native land
 on the table and token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale
 little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armour as she had been with the glittering front of peace of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
 mother cried she i see you here luck luck
 and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
 pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
 but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the aperture perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
 there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a ball
 pearl seeing the rose bushes began to cry for our bed rose and would not be pacified
 he wore blue silk stockings bloody pants with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket and bright blue braided with gold
 his hat had a peaked crown in a flat brim and around the brim with a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
 instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turn over tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
 for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived
 when they were outside simply batched the door and started up the path
 no one would disturb their little house even if any one came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
 at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gallican the path divided
 he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbour
 all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc an ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
 then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pipt
 unconnected the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all them blew opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
 i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
 we have come from a fire lonely a place than this alone mere place
 and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
 odo had never eaten such a fine meal and all his life

 the woman seemed thoughtful

 he takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
 you must know said margaret when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mammy the witch who used to leave in the country of the gallican to the north of here
 the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
 i think the next glass catholic magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and they prove of some use to us
 i'm afraid i don't know much about the land of ice
 you see i've lived all my life without monkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
 that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
 i think i must show you my patchwork girl said marvel laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
 but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cope the meals and wash the dishes
 yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
 a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and collars of cloth only at least so together
 sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colours are so mixed up
 when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from join to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
 at the emerald city where our princess ozma lives green is the popular color
 i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
 ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder
 margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and in apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout
 the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
 the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids
 gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is oft compliable
 no i forgot on the bout the brains exclaimed the woman
 well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
 she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
 i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in the servant
 she ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four battles from the fire
 their contents had all availed away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
 very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
 no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
 odo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
 he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes
 most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
 i am got allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe where the crooked stem and began to smoke
 the wizard of oz who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and untold he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is nearly the assistant of the great sorceress
 it truly is asserted the magician
 i know used them as ornamental statuary in my garden
 dear me what a chatter box are getting to be bunk mouthed the magician who was pleased with the compliment
 asked the voice in scornful accents
 the grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest
 the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
 but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with a knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sex which descended from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
 constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men
 some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
 they asserted with confidence and almost of exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers in violet
 bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the dentists
 prescribed by the single and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the dentists still maintained in some provinces particularly in commedia their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate
 since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savages ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
 the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
 after proceeding a few miles the progress of hockey who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
 he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
 distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingachgook were frequent and earnest
 yet here we within a short range of the schools and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
 let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
 chingachgook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
 the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
 it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
 see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
 if a rock or rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clue they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
 extinguished brands were lying around a spring the awful of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
 a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
 the examination however resulted in no discovery
 the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvial
 run back uncas and bring me the size of the singers foot
 notwithstanding the high resolution of hockey he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
 in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
 in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of bales asked to speak he was somewhat sceptical on the subject of a bear's singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
 there was something in his air and the manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
 the ancenis hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
 the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
 can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
 come come returned hawkeye unceasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
 the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
 i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly hymn can you lead me to him
 the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
 the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very centre of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
 for a five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas weary but close observers of the manner of their captive
 delivered in a strong tone of ascent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
 they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjuror to enter
 but the bear instead of obeying maintained of the seat it had taken and growled
 the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off they must blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david and proving the hint he received they must stand further off their off
 then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
 it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
 lucas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful wit's
 the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
 what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer as as good as nothing
 the delawares are children of the tortoise in the outstrip the deer
 uncas who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
 but hockey who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself into his companion
 so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
 well what can't be done by main courage and war must be done by circumvention
 as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
 my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
 if you are not then knocked on the head your being an composer will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
 said two is for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
 bravely and generously as he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
 keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
 if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
 hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
 then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
 god bless you friend i do believe your sent is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts in the force of temptation
 the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
 will the herons hear his groans
 the mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
 he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
 monk as cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
 i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
 i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
 my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
 without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
 i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
 i was absent rather more than an hour
 the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion a
 the moment i looked at my table i was aware that some one had rubbage among my papers
 the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
 the alternative was that some one passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
 i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair will i made a most careful examination of the room
 a broken tip of lad was lying there also
 not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough where clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
 above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
 to the best of my belief they were rolled up
 did any one know that these proofs would be there no one saved the printer
 i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
 somewhat seems to me
 now mister sons at your sposa
 above were three students one on each story
 then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his net crane he looked into the room
 there is no opening except the one painting said our learned to guide
 i am afraid there are no signs here said he
 one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
 you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
 the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
 as a matter of fact he could not said solmes for i entered by the side door
 her long would have taken to do that using every possible contraction a quarter an hour not less
 then he tossed it down and seized the next
 he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
 mister songs was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
 chums held out a small chip with the letters in and and the space of clear wood after them you see
 what son i have always done you and injustice there are others
 i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
 as homes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and in clearness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
 home sterne away and stooped suddenly to the floor hallo what is this
 homes had it out on his open palm in the glare of the elector alight
 what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
 i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
 and they are all in for this examination yes
 one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
 let us see the suspicions i will look after the proofs
 my scholar has been left a very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
 the top floor belongs to miles the clare
 i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
 he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet retain of his life
 but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
 did you look at these papers on the table
 how came you to leave the key in the door
 any one in the room could get out yes sir
 i really don't think he knew much about at mister holmes
 only for a minute or so
 oh i would not venture to say sir
 you haven't seen any of them no sir
 it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind
 he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
 the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
 no name's please said holmes as we not to guilt her store
 of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
 that is very important said holmes
 you don't seem to realize in the position
 to morrow was the examination
 i cannot allow the examination to be held of one of the papers has been tamboured with the situation must be faced
 it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
 i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good bye
 when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
 the foul mouth fellow at the top
 he is the one with the worst record
 why banister the servant what's his game in the matter
 he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
 my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
 no good my dear watson
 i think so you have formed a conclusion
 yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
 look at that he held out his hand
 on the palm where three little pyramids of black day clay
 and one more this morning
 in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
 he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
 you know him i think so
 if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court marshal
 no sir certainly not
 there was no man sir
 his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
 just close the door said holmes
 we want to know mister colorist how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
 for a moment hilcrest with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
 come come said holmes kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
 well i'll don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know injustice
 he could examine the papers in his own office
 the indian i also thought nothing of
 when i approached your room i examined the window
 no one less than that would have a chance
 i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
 he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where with several sharp spikes
 no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
 a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
 he put his shoes on the table
 gloves said the young man
 suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
 have i told the truth mister gilbert
 i had a letter here mister songs which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
 it would be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
 it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
 if mister solmes saw them the game was up
 in the debate between the signor societies her defence of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
 the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
 john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
 better go he had counselled sententiously
 might learn something useful down there
 but john is no society just elementary work
 then looking up tombs county
 five and cromwells there big plantations rated it two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
 some others too big cotton county
 you ought to know john if i teach negroes i'll scarcely see much of people in the own class
 at any rate i say go
 here she was teaching dirty children in the smell of confused orders and bodily perspiration was to her times unbearable
 she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies in reforms
 so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the laying back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
 cotton she paused
 she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch in sight
 the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward
 there might be a bit of portray here and there but most of his place was such desperate prose
 her guard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
 cotton is a wonderful thing is it not voice she said rather primly
 miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remarked to seem called for
 don't know will of all things inwardly commented miss taylor literally born and cotton and oh well as much as to ask was the use she turned again to go
 i suppose though it's too early for them then came the explosion
 goop was don't grow on the tops of vials but on the ground on the roads like aims is that so
 the golden fleece it's the silver fleece he hearkened
 some time you tell me please won't you
 now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton
 the honourable charles smith miss sarah's brother was walking swiftly up town from mister easterly wall street office and his face was pale
 at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured fact and he was slated for the sinnet
 why should he not be as other men
 she was not herself notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others
 as she awaited her guest she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and as quietude for her social functions were fuel to night there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james citing the rich english manufacturer and lady briton mister and missus van cropole mister harry caswell and his sister
 missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith there cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith with a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith with with a
 she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister caswall express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
 do believe in some education asked mary taylor
 i believe in the training of people to the asked capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
 but cassell added significantly capacity differs in homily between races
 the balder pools were sure this and the englishman distancing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admitted the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharper scrutiny before being allowed much education and opportunities opportunities opportunities to them
 positively heroic added cassell avoiding his sister's eyes
 but we are neither exactly welcome
 mary tallow however related the tale of boa to missus gray's private ear later
 fortunately said mister van to pool northern hosen sovereign's all arriving at a bell of mutual understanding on most of these matters
 he knew the silver fleece his enjolras must be ruined
 it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built around it
 ah the dwarf the cruel swamp
 the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
 he fancied to know if she too new or new and cared not or cared and knew not
 she was so strange in human a creature
 the world was water veiled in mists
 then of a sudden admit day the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel to the earth steam
 where was the use of imagining
 the bougon had been level with the dikes a week ago and now
 perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
 he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
 he splashed to stamp the long farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
 then he looked down the lagoon was dry
 he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of all of green they tall wet and willowy
 the squares of cotton's sharp edge heavy were just about to verse to bowls
 or one long moment he paused stupid a gape with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against the tree
 he gazed about put hext astonished
 here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pains some one had doubted an now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by long and cook it way thus allowing it to empty directly
 he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost corah
 the years of the days of her dying were ten
 the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
 up in the sick rooms or a lay on the little white bed
 the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
 for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at son in bird and tree
 she rose over the fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
 she had been born within its borders within his boarders she had lived and grown and within its boarder she had met her love
 on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island lo the cotton lay before her
 the chair was empty but he knew
 he darted through the trees and bossed a tall man strongly but slily made
 it is a very fine old place of red brick softened by a peal powdery lichen which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly constant ornaments
 but the windows are patched with wooden panes and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
 for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind the livery blacky who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
 a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bearer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wool stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
 and what through the left hand window
 several clothes horses a pillion a spinning wheel and an old box white open and stuffed full of coloured rags
 at the edge of this box their lives a great wooden doll which so far as mutilation is concerned there is a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
 the history of the house is plain now
 but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making the sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed
 where the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister goby the hooraw otherwise saddler who entertains them with the latest treddleston gossip
 hetty sorrow often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use
 do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight in thirty a fair complexion and sandy hair well shapen like footed
 the vainly likeness between her and her niece dynamos with a contrast between her keenness and dynasts seraphic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha in mary
 her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came with a year shot seemed to take up an unfinished luxury as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
 the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why a consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
 to all appearance molly had got through her after it in her work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great despatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
 spinning indeed
 i never knew your equals for callousness
 who taught you to scrub up floor i should like to know
 come the wool for the widows indeed
 that's what you'd like to be doing is it
 that's the way with you that's the row you'd all like to go headlong to ruin
 mister oat leaves indeed
 you are a rare and permitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by
 money myer and striped told these put it down to warm
 cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
 she's going to put the ironing things away
 money i did like to do into the barn to tommy to see the widow
 no no no no totty have get her feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her ire
 did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
 totty however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and in a mouth of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
 and she was very fond of you two aunt rachel
 i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
 when she had that bad illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i am taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
 and there's linen in the house as i could well spare you for i got lots of sheeting and table clothing and towering isn't made up
 but not more than what's in the bible and said dinah
 nay dear and you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work in their families
 we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it
 i can no more help spending my life in trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little totty crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
 i have strong assurance that no evil will have it you and my uncle in the children for many thing i have done
 i didn't preach without direction
 direction
 i am a common patience with you
 by this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plain name and to come in
 said mister unwin with his stately cordiality
 oh sir don't mention it said missus poyser
 i delight in your kitchen
 poyser is not at home missy
 said captain daddy thorn sitting himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door
 no sir he isn't he's gone to monitor to see mister west the factor about the wall
 but there's father and barn sir if he'd be of any use
 no thank you i'll just look at the helps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
 i must come another day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
 for if is anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
 oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed he wouldn't like it at all
 but you know more about that than i do sir
 i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
 i know his farm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
 by the bye i've never seen your dairy i must see your dairy missus poyser
 this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her moat pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
 oh i've no doubt it's in capital order
 the paris planned like that of the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
 the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of whole burned by the

 the dynamo electric machine bo small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
 owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
 why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
 there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
 broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is aristocratically opposed to loosen wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
 everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
 for some years it was not found these abble to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
 it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
 but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a far mouse the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
 edison was intolerant of sham and spotty and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope gesture and galvanometer and galvanometer him that could not stand cross examination by microscope gesture and galvanometer and galvanometer him galvanometer him galvanometer gesture and galvanometer and galvanometer cimeter and galvanometer beninobenone comer denominate phaenomenon beninobenone commencement bosome bestowest entomologists lonesomest tenor tube tub tub tub tub gesture tub tube tube tub tube tube tub tube tube tube tube antae a a a a tube a
 unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly government regulated than those amenable for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
 mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time
 he obtained the desired speed and lowered with a friction break also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
 then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so in engine for his purpose is must produce light at all times
 edison had installed his historic first great central station system in the york on the multiple arch system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system three kind
 he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
 the strong position held by the edison's system under this strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate emphasis to incandescent lighting
 it was specially suited for a trial platte also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation
 the street conductors were of the overhead whole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build any equip central stations and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build any equip central stations and equipped central stations
 meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent in generous at practically the same time
 i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction departed and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up and that i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before before we we we we ast store she ate ast ate ast ast ast starer sorehead dar hereafterward bed boughed d teleprojectoscope thar gougou up up up up up champ up achish chuck champ up up up ach up ach ath up ach up ach up ach up up ach up up up up achish up
 but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
 they were later used as reserved machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edison but they remain impracticable as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three
 the ark lamp and stalled outside a customer's premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many knights in the month anne was paid for at that rate subject to reade for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
 edison held that the electricity soul must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
 there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject bethought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed to be exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly
 hence the addison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
 the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
 associated with the simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immediately from such tampering as would permit deft of current or damage
 the standard edison neither practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another sat being substituted
 in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
 the others having been an operation to short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
 in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison eliminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison feeder was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights current
 the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
 he weighed and regained the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
 he felt he was up against him and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
 the problem was sought
 we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
 we had neither as in which there were two bottles of liquid
 here she would stay comforted and soon among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turn at the gardener who sent polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
 every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time where fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
 then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
 somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
 if she could only see franz for just one moment
 oh she's always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
 at this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped phronsie
 but polly couldn't speak and a jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
 asked bronzy with her little face close to polly's own
 now you'll stay cried van say polly won't you
 oh you'll are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
 isn't he splendid cried jasper an intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
 there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
 i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
 asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper's side
 yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
 oh no apter i must go by my very own self
 bare jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the sight of jasper's face
 don't mind it polly whispered jasper twasn't her fault
 dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
 how did her mother ever let her go
 she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
 i didn't have any fear as if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complaisantly
 he cried and high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all who soothe his fancy
 and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had the burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space at time
 at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously

 his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
 from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checkerberry marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
 from the graveyard gate one can count the dozen gaily painted farm houses the wielded weather veins on the big red barns week at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
 the heir and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other

 please wait for me marie angel coaxed
 i never see loose sighed over here
 how proud you've got since you came home i wish i had an attila to know my orchard
 i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
 indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
 they think you're proud because you've been away to school or something
 there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
 on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall o sage orange hedges their glassy green mocking off the yellow fields
 any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra benison
 there is even a white row of bee hives and the orchard under the walnut trees

 a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
 the archer was sparkling and rippling in the sun
 that invitation decided her
 oh but i'm glad to get this place mode
 just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
 we never had so many of them in here before
 i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too
 i suppose that's the wet decent to them
 if exclaiming to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
 aren't you splashed look up spider whips all over the grass
 in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his side with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
 clovery picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she thought a shower of rain drops on her neck and hair
 an abial mowed his way slowly down toward the jerry trees
 that summer the reigns had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than chabot and his man could do to keep up with the corps the orchard was an exacted wilderness
 i don't know all of them but i know then thence are
 if i feel that way i feel that way
 he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with aint pink like light coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
 he dropped a handful into her lap
 yes don't you
 oh ever so much only you seems kind of stayed and school teacher
 when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him
 it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl
 i liked to talk to carve about new york and what a fellow can do there
 oh amy
 surely you are not thinking of going off there
 lark's face fell under his brooding gaze
 i am sure alexandra hope you will stay on here she murmured
 i don't let the stand around him a gone
 i want to be doing something on my own account
 sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a tablecloth
 i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
 i wish you weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
 thank you he returned assuredly
 and you never used to be cross to me
 i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss mary
 but abial if i understand then are a good times or over we can never do nice things together any more
 and anyhow there's nothing too understand
 that won't last it will go away and things will be just as they used to
 i pray for you but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself
 i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i want pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
 than all our good times are over
 saturday august fifteenth the sea and broken all round no land in sight
 the horizon seems extremely distant
 all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
 you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye ages
 one might be would less reason than now
 i am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the seat is so wide
 we are rising time in the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pine on a raft
 he called the sea upon and i longed the wage ticking a little sail
 therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
 i take this is my answer and i leave the professor divide his lips with impatience
 sunday august sixteenth
 nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshen
 but there seem no reason of fear
 the shadow of the wrath was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
 truly the sea is of infinite width
 it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why not
 these thoughts agitated me all day in my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep
 i shudder as i recall these monstrous to my remembrance
 i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in the length
 i suppose professor leading brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed ocean from side to side
 tuesday august eighteenth
 during his watch i slept
 two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
 the wrath was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
 there is a whale a well cried the professor
 flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little craft with a rapidity greater than that of expressed trains
 two monsters only retreating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
 i can distinguish the eye of if the absorbs glowing like a red hot co and his large as a man's head
 its jaw is enormous and according the naturalists it is armed with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
 those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity
 suddenly the diodorus and the alessio source disappear below leaving a walpus eddying in the water
 as for the theodoric has he returned to his submarine cavern
 the earrings become lost in the distance
 the weather if we may use the terror will change before long
 the atmosphere is charged with vapors breaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
 the electric light can scarcely penetrate to the dense curtain which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
 the air is heavy the sea is calm
 from time the time a fleecy tuft of miss would yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of gray and loses itself in the opaque an impenetrable mass a
 the atmosphere is evidently charged in sir charged with electricity
 the wind never lulls but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
 there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
 those clouds seem as if they were going to quest the sea
 on the mast already i see the light play of element saint arab's fire the outstretched sill catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
 but if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
 that will be the safest no no cover
 the piled up vapours contents into water and the air put in the violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a whirlwind
 gaster's night
 from the under surface of the clouds there are continual missions of lurid light the electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need be slaved with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again
 i referred if a thermometer it in a case the figure is obliterated
 is the atmosphere condition having once reached the density to become final
 the raft bears on still to the south east
 at noon the violence of the storm redouble
 each of us is lashed is some part of the raft
 the waves rise above our heads
 they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
 he nods his consent
 the fire ball half of it white half azure blue and the size of a ten inch shell loose holily about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing philosophy as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
 here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just kims the powder magazine horrible
 we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon its knees but his head down to avoid it
 a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
 we suffer stifling pains
 and how odd the directions were look
 poor alice
 it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
 oh what she be savage if i've kept her waiting
 alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day
 and yesterday thinks well on just as usual
 i would have i have been changed in the night
 i almost take i can remember feeling a little different
 i'll try if i know all the things i used to know
 i shall never get to chanty at that rate
 how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in would gently smiling jaws
 no i've made up my mind about it if i'm mabel i'll stay down here
 it'll be no use there putting their heads down and sang come up again do her
 i'm so very tired of being all alone here
 and i declare it's too bad that it is
 i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swim about trying to find her way out
 i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being browned in my own tears
 that will be a queer thing for to be sure
 i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse
 cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
 we won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not we indeed
 we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
 the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american stream why him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless me make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
 let us begin with that his commentary undulations
 the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and it times became oppressive
 it was written in latin
 the word had to be condensed
 a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary annotations
 much later when a friend of his was preparing addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my relations for instance
 in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students and the course of galatians and roar prepared the manuscript for the printer
 it presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ merits alone
 but the essence of luther's lectures is there
 the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke too
 the word of our god shall stand forever
 in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
 they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
 he was the last to turn the christ
 the balking later in his beneath us
 indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
 do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church
 against these boasting false apostles boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry
 as the ambassador of a government is honoured for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
 paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of god
 paul and a fossil not of men et cetera
 yet he calls ministers to the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets in a fossils
 paul the cares that the false apostles were called or scent neither by men nor by man
 the most they could claim as that they were sent by others
 he mentioned the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
 the call was not to be taken lightly
 for a person to possess knowledge is not enough
 his spoils one's best work
 when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his corps
 i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
 i know nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught so pastry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
 this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
 in god the father who raised him from the dead
 the clashings superadds on first sight
 these porters of the righteousness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
 in this whole pistol paul treats of the resurrection of christ
 by his resurrection christ one the victory over law sin flesh whirled devil death hell and every evil
 first two
 and all the brethren which are with me
 this she go far and shutting the mouse of the false apostles
 although the brethren with me are not a possible like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
 they do not go with the enemies of the gospel precocity they go for the questions are
 why did they not invade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to god this princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
 we look for that reward which i hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man
 not all the galatians had become perverted
 these means cannot be contaminate
 they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
 wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though antichrist reigns there
 so much for the title of the apostle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
 grace be to you in peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
 the terms of grace and peace are common turns with paul and are now pretty well understood
 the greeting of the apostle's refreshing
 grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
 the world rends this of permission doctrine
 experience aloofness
 however the grace and peace of god will
 men should not speculate about the nature of god
 was it not enough to say from god the father
 to do so as to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
 he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
 embrace him and forget about the nature of god
 did not christ himself say i am the way in the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
 when you are you about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
 we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
 at the same time paul confirms are creed that christ is very god
 that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to the sense grace and peace
 to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone concrete these peasants the angels cannot
 otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and piece from our lord jesus christ
 the areas took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
 mohammed also speak highly of christ
 paul sticks to his theme
 he never loses sight of the purpose of his apostle
 not gold or silver or passical lands or an angel but himself what for
 not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness before sins
 underscored these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
 how may we obtain remission of our sins
 pallisers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our since
 since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they could not be put away by our own efforts
 this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
 the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this
 the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
 but we are careless we make light of sin
 we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss him
 this passage then there is out the fact that all men are sold under sin
 this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works but we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
 this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
 but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
 on the other hand we are not to regard them is so terrible that we must despair
 he passes abruptly from persons the ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses a rather does not distinguish
 the influence which the didius has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
 in the supposed depths of this dialogue the new platonists found hidden meanings in connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
 they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly correct rustic in him his effort to realize in connect obstructions was not understood by them at all
 the resultance of the modern common tares on the gilias falling into the absurdities of the new plaid mists
 in the present day we are well aware that an engine philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
 the fancies of the mule plainness are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian europe and is not wholly extinct in our own day
 but they have nothing to do with the interdiction of plato and dispirit they are opposed to him
 we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of him besides the true analogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
 the diamond is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this curb the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
 but he has not as yet the find this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in drinking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge
 with her acquits he acknowledges the perpetual flux like an evangelist he asserts the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the anvharians he supposes the mystery of the world
 many if not all the elements of the aristocratic philosophy are included in the aeneas
 it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
 the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
 the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the moronic dialogues
 but plato has not the same mystery over his instrument which he exhibits in the futures or emporium
 nothing can exceed the beauty or art of introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
 but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
 he could write in one style but not in another the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
 and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of accretions
 there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings
 plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
 socrates begins to the nearest with the summary of the republic
 and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
 and therefore to you i turn to me as citizen of lawless who are at once a philosopher in a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be singularly accomplished into her socrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in arthur's
 i will you to me as a proofs i approve
 listen then socrates to a tale of soars who being the friend of bromides like great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
 some poems of solemn were recited by the boys
 in what was the subject of the polar said the person will make the remark
 the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
 but the memory of their exploits had passed away owing to the left of time and the extinction of the actors
 tell us said the other the whole story and where solemn heard the story
 but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us magistrate for ever in our temples
 the genealogies which you have recited to oppose out of your own anne old solemn are a mere children story
 four in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and dead the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
 solemn marvelled and desired to be informed of the particulars
 nine thousand years have you laughed since you found it yours and eight thousand since you found it arts as our annals record
 many laws exist among this which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
 i will briefly describe them to you and it shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers

 the most berners of them all was the overthrow of the island of the planters
 for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled in vade and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
 this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
 but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
 then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world who adown to the creation of men and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by use of the inducements
 but already at point in economic evolution far agitating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a formless elaborate system
 the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
 such consumption as false to the women is nearly incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life
 with a further advance in culture this to boom a change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be at a boo or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
 in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belonged to the leisure class
 under the taboo certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
 drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become seraphic as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
 it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into every day speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
 the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a contention directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
 with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradual weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should conceal only for the benefit of their masters
 the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the secret that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
 the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of comely the amity and religion these motives are also present in the later development that they do not continue to be the sole motives of comely the amity and religion these motives are also present in the later development that they do not continue to be the sole motives
 there is a moralist leverett system of rank and grates
 this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
 many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time less a men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarce let all others only partially to be rated as my calenus consumers
 so many of them however as make up the retainer and anderson of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
 many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of bestirred having turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wifes and children their servants retainers et cetera
 the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or a sensible
 the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be rustly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
 that the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
 so those officers which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be class as ostensibly predatory employments
 whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to directly with a primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires are reflected on a civic character the directly with a primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires are reflected on a civic character
 the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
 in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide
 the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradual in narrows the wife remains the last
 but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of our caress leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
 in the communities of the western culture this point is a present found among the lower middle class
 if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a moralist for tutor's circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through the great economic law of voice at effort effort they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through the great economic law of voice at effort through the great economic or or ore or or ore or or or or or or or or or or o or or or or for or or of or of or or or o of or of or or or of or off or or or or o of or offer or or favor convoy of fomose invoices chrysalises boise of boise boise boise of boise visa disaster boise bavois
 the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of a seems the man and presently also the children virtually ceased to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remained spiritually the soul exponent of the households peculiarity
 very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last regents of pecuniary decencies put away
 there is no class on no country that as yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
 a questionest which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to effect
 each will there for serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
 the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
 it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of high thing the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
 it is also noticeable that the so of subjective consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is that it spec's in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the populations greatest
 consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
 among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the needing of neighbourhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute the comforts known through the needful of neighbourhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute a
 the result is a great ability of the labor important printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable buddy of workmen
 under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset it
 but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to all the rank fair mature both wasteful conception of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the coarse i peaceful culture
 are the circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favour upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
 a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by resort to make belief men in intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of a ulceration and budded in their official style and title and a traffic
 the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
 throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of good sore of services or human life rents the obvious indication that in order to effectually men the consume is good thing it must be an expenditure of superfluities
 as used in the speech of every day life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
 the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this cannon of conspicuous waste
 but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of every day life implies deprecation of what is characterized a wistful
 instruct accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste at such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
 an article may be useful and wasteful both and its civility took consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most faring proportions
 and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity
 why are we to be denied each other's society

 i am not depreciating it when i say that in these times it is not rare

 you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
